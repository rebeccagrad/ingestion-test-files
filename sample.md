# Ingestion Test Markdown

This is a **markdown file** that should be converted to RTE HTML — _not_ wrapped in a CodeBlock.

## Features Tested

- Code block ingestion for recognized extensions
- Root directory filtering
- Taxonomy tag inheritance
- Taxonomy change detection and re-sync

## Code Example

```java
System.out.println("This is inline code in markdown");
```

> This blockquote should be converted to proper RTE markup.
